# Project-3-Markdown-File
# Whack dat Grass turned Virtual Interview

This project was an interesting one to say the least. It started out as a an app to connect people with lawn care service professionals. They would be able to post their address, the size of their lawn and the services they needed. Then a lawn service professional could go in and see the location, services required and bid on that specific job. The problem became that I took on something bigger than myself and I had already spent 30-40 hours on multiple iterations / re-do's by the time I had somewhat figured out React. Oh and I was trying to move cities at the same time.

However it just so happened that at my at work, we released a working version of a project for which I built the front end. I have decided to submit a demo of that to supplement the files from my project in React because: 
    1. My React app (despite the many hours put in...) kind of looks like trash. 
    2. All the knowledge I used for this work project I actually learned in the bootcamp.

###The demo linked below: 

Basically our company designs simulations to test drive a prospective employees performance before making a hiring decision. Our simulations can and most often are delivered remotely via email and the browser. We found that many times our clients would like to take it a step further and interview whoever passes the simulation remotely as well. However, they want to do it asynchronously. The job candidate gets to do the interview remotely on their own time and the employer gets to view the response on his/her own time and rate that response. As such we set out to build an interview tool without the unnecessary bells and whistles to complement our suite of simulations creating a seamless process for clients and their job candidates.

I was given the schema of the backend of the existing interview product and asked to create newly designed front end to match. The front end is built in bootstrap and the iframe video recorder is a webrtc api from a company called TokBox. We are still working on the frontend of the pages before and after the actual interview starts / ends as well as the employer side of the product where they can view responses and rate the candidates.
